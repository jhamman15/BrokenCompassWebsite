                                    to take into account when selecting a pair of boots.

                                <h3>Height - How high a shoe come up on your ankle is very important for terrain and warmth.</h3>
                                <p class="boot_type">Short Height - These boots are best for light warm weather days. They do not provide much ankle
                                    support but allow for a fast, quick hike.</p>
                                <p class="boot_type">Mid Height - These are a good catch all boot. If you are unsure which to go with, these will most
                                    likely fit any terrain you will come across. A mid height boot provide good ankle support for rough or slippery
                                    terrain.</p>
                                <p class="boot_type">Tall Height - These boots are generally best for cold-weather hikes. If you plan to do lots of
                                    camping or hiking during winter months, or you live in an area that gets lots of snow, this is a good option.
                                    This type of boot supports your ankle extremely well and provide great warmth for your toes.</p>

                                    to store your gear and keep it mostly dry.

                                </h2>
                                <p class="bag_info">There are a few important things about picking out a sleeping bag.
                                    The biggest one is the temperature rating. Knowing roughly the array of temperature you plan to be out in will
                                    make it much easier to choose. If cold-weather camping, it's almost always better to be go with a bit warmer instead
                                    of the opposite.
